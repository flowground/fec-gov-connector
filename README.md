## API Description

This API allows you to explore the way candidates and committees fund their campaigns. 

 The FEC API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. 

 There is a lot of data, but a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in schedule_a. 

 Get an [API key here](https://api.data.gov/signup/). That will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 120 calls per minute to [APIinfo@fec.gov](mailto:apiinfo@fec.gov). You can also ask questions and discuss the data in the [FEC data Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data). API changes will also be added to this group in advance of the change. 

 

 The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. 

 A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you canâ€™t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations. [Learn more here](https://www.fec.gov/updates/sale-or-use-contributor-information/).

### Each report represents the summary information from FEC Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P.<br/>
> These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee.<br/>
> Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements<br/>
> are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.<br/>
> <br/>
> By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict<br/>
> to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to view only reports that<br/>
> have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.<br/>
> <br/>
> Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that<br/>
> submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements,<br/>
> look at the summary and detailed summary pages of FEC Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.<br/>

### Schedule A records describe itemized receipts reported by a committee. This is where<br/>
> you can look for individual contributors. If you are interested in<br/>
> individual donors, `/schedules/schedule_a` will be the endpoint you use.<br/>
> <br/>
> Once a person gives more than a total of $200, the donations of that person must be<br/>
> reported by committees that file F3, F3X and F3P forms.<br/>
> <br/>
> Contributions $200 and under are not required to be itemized, but you can find the total<br/>
> amount of these small donations by looking up the "unitemized" field in the `/reports`<br/>
> or `/totals` endpoints.<br/>
> <br/>
> When comparing the totals from reports to line items. the totals will not match unless you<br/>
> only look at items where `"is_individual":true` since the same transaction is in the data<br/>
> multiple ways to explain the way it may move though different committees as an earmark.<br/>
> See the `is_individual` sql function within the migrations for more details.<br/>
> <br/>
> For the Schedule A aggregates, such as by_occupation and by_state, include only unique individual<br/>
> contributions. See below for full methodology.<br/>
> <br/>
> __Methodology for determining unique, individual contributions__<br/>
> <br/>
> For receipts over $200 use FEC code line_number to identify individuals.<br/>
> <br/>
> The line numbers that specify individuals that are automatically included:<br/>
> <br/>
> Line number with description<br/>
>     - 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs),<br/>
>          Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs)<br/>

> <br/>
> Of those transactions,[under $200, and having "earmark" in the memo text OR transactions having the codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.<br/>

> <br/>
> All receipt data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which<br/>

> even-numbered year.<br/>
> <br/>
> Due to the large quantity of Schedule A filings, this endpoint is not paginated by<br/>
> page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in<br/>
> the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For<br/>

> To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and<br/>

the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not
have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both

### Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data<br/>
> explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are<br/>
> reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.<br/>
> <br/>
> The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which<br/>
> is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will<br/>
> default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,<br/>
> even-numbered year.<br/>
> <br/>
> Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by<br/>
> page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in<br/>
> the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For<br/>
> example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of<br/>
> results with the following pagination information:<br/>
> <br/>
> ```<br/>
> pagination: {<br/>
>     pages: 965191,<br/>
>     per_page: 20,<br/>
>     count: 19303814,<br/>
>     last_indexes: {<br/>
>         last_index: "230906248",<br/>
>         last_disbursement_date: "2014-07-04"<br/>
>     }<br/>
> }<br/>
> ```<br/>
> <br/>
> To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and<br/>
> `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through<br/>
> these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise<br/>
> some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance<br/>
> and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.<br/>
> <br/>
> Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for<br/>
> large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

### Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures. For example, if a super PAC<br/>

> <br/>
> An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication "expressly advocating the election or<br/>
> defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,<br/>
> or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or their agents, or<br/>
> a political party or its agents."<br/>

> Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures<br/>
> and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in<br/>
> `/schedule/schedule_e/`.<br/>

> which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.<br/>
> <br/>
> The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To see<br/>
> totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle<br/>
> is the next year -- for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.<br/>
> <br/>
> For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.
